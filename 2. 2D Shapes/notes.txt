START
0. Ask for challenges!
1, Use the Book of Shaders preset
2. Set the resolution to 1280 x 1280

Chapter 1: Circle
1. Make a uniform float for the circle radius
2, Find the distance of the pixel from the center
3. Subtract the radius from a gradient distance to form a distance field from -Infinity to Infinity
4. Threshold this gradient field at 0

Chapter 2: Rectangle
1. Make a uniform vec2 float for the rectangle size
2. Show simple rectangle function
3. Find distance from coordinate to rectangle edge
4. Determine if coordiante is inside or not with "max"
5. Find the distance that outside pixels are from the edge
6. Find the distance that inside pixels are from the edge
7. Add them to form a gradient distance field from -Infinity to Infinity
8. Threshold this gradient field at 0

Chapter 3: Morph
1. Use "mix" to interpolate between the two distance fields with the mouse
2. Threshold the combined gradient at 0
3, Make a uniform clock
4. Plug in time to the interpolator
5. Modulo the time
6. Sine the time
7. Add easing with smoothstep

Chapter 4: Loop and Blend
1. Create a color pallete based on a Klee painting
2. Create multiple copies of each morphed shape
3. Blend the shapes together using addition
4. Adjust the size of each shape so they don't cover each other
5. Blend the shapes together using "mix"
